This intructional assumes you have some sort of git management software installed, as well as Node Package Manager (NPM) or Yarn. A Postgresql server is also required, for the database part of the requested solution.


First clone the project from github to whatever location you prefer, with the command
	
	git clone git@github.com:Avenar/codetest_todo.git

Afterwards, use the following command to install node dependencies:

	npm install
	
The frontend/backend should now be set up.

Open a console/terminal and navigate to the binaries of your Postgresql installation (or anywhere if you have psql added to your PATH).

In the following commands, you will have to replace "username" with whatever admin account you have for your Postgresql database, that has permissions to create users and new databases.

Use the following command to create the test user that the backend uses, from the create_user.sql file:

	psql -U username --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on -f create_user.sql

Use the following command to restore the database from the codetest.sql file:

	psql -U username --set ON_ERROR_STOP=on -f codetest.sql
	
On-error-stop is added to prevent messing up existing databases in case something conflicts.
Don't want to ruin your previously existing data, should i happen to have accidentally named
something the same as you.
In this case, please contact me to discuss how to remedy the situation.



Everything should now work, and you can use the "runServer.bat" file, to launch the site AND open your browser to the webpage hosted.

Alternatively, if you do not want to use .bat files (or aren't on windows at all), open a console/terminal and navigate to the folder where you cloned the project, and run:

	node index.js
	
And afterwards open your browser and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/".
